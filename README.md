# Blips-and-Boxes
Little game modeled after the flashing boxes section at the end of the Navy ASVAB

As far as I've heard/read on reddit, everybody kind of tanks this section of the exam bc:
1) it's hard
2) it's at the end of three hour exam so folks are pretty fried already
3) only Navy takes it so I think most people don't really prepare for it and/or see it coming.
4) nobody seems to know what happens if you score well on it. Like math and science sections people definitely know they need to score a certain X points in order to get the job they want, but this section's score doesn't appear in the requisites for any rating, at least that I've seen.

So I figured some folks might want to practice this section beforehand. If you get into some top secret, Area 51 rating... don't let me know, I guess?
